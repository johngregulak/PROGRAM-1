1. git clone (Paste URL) 	//Clone repo
2. (Make changes)
3. git add * (or) add -A		//stage the changes
4. git commit -m "(comments)"
5. git push			//pushes it onto github

Notes:
Use 'git status'
	-if it says you are ahead of master repo then you need to add
	-if anything is red you need to commit

Add comments and changes here. I made this as a self reminder and help you if you need it.
